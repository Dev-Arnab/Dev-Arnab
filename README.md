# Hi there, I'm Dev 👋

**`Computer Science + Data Science @ Michigan State University`**  
**Aspiring Researcher | AI/ML Enthusiast | Global Learner | Builder with Purpose**

Welcome to my GitHub! I'm a passionate Bangladeshi undergraduate student at Michigan State University, majoring in Computer Science and Data Science with a concentration in Artificial Intelligence and a minor in Business. I explore the intersections of computation, biology, and global impact through research, projects, and community engagement.

## 🔬 Current Research

**Undergraduate Researcher @ The Adami Lab**  
I'm working on evolutionary protein function prediction using deep learning and information theory. Recently, I trained models (IDSeq) on over **50,000 YAP65 protein sequences**, achieving **Spearman correlations up to 0.80**, and optimized the model pipeline with **multi-threading for 75% faster performance**.

## 💻 Featured Projects

☕ [Foundation Models for Satellite Image Intelligence](https://github.com/zainakhalil/Ursa-Space-1A.git)  
Explored the use of open-source pre-trained computer vision models for classifying vessels and icebergs in synthetic aperture radar (SAR) satellite imagery

🧠 [Neural Decoding of Face Identity and Orientation in Primate Anterior Medial Cortex](https://github.com/Dev-Arnab/Neural-Decoding-of-Face-Identity-and-Orientation.git)  
Implemented machine learning decoding techniques to analyze electrophysiological data from the Anterior Medial (AM) face patch of two macaque monkeys, Bert and Lupo

✍️ [Handwritten Digit Recognition](https://github.com/Dev-Arnab/Handwritten-Digit-Recognition.git)  
Built and trained a custom CNN with TensorFlow/Keras on the MNIST dataset. Achieved 98%+ accuracy in under 1 epoch.

🌱 [Invasive Species Simulation](https://github.com/Dev-Arnab/invasive-species-simulation.git)  
Simulated Arctic ecosystems to study extinction risk from invasive king crabs. Ran 5,000+ simulations with >99% ML model accuracy in predicting outcomes.

🏢 [Pacific Tax Solutions Inc](https://github.com/Dev-Arnab/Pacific-Tax-Solutions-Inc.git)  
An interactive website for a small business startup for tax services
