# Hi there, I'm Dev Arnab 👋

**`Computer Science + Data Science @ Michigan State University`**  
**Aspiring Researcher | AI/ML Enthusiast | Global Learner | Builder with Purpose**

Welcome to my GitHub! I'm a passionate Bangladeshi undergraduate student at Michigan State University, majoring in Computer Science and Data Science with a concentration in Artificial Intelligence and a minor in Business. I explore the intersections of computation, biology, and global impact through research, projects, and community engagement.

## 🔬 Current Research

**Undergraduate Researcher @ The Adami Lab**  
I'm working on evolutionary protein function prediction using deep learning and information theory. Recently, I trained models (IDSeq) on over **50,000 YAP65 protein sequences**, achieving **Spearman correlations up to 0.80**, and optimized the model pipeline with **multi-threading for 75% faster performance**.

## 💻 Featured Projects

🧠 **Handwritten Digit Recognition**  
Built and trained a custom CNN with TensorFlow/Keras on the MNIST dataset. Achieved 98%+ accuracy in under 1 epoch.

🌱 **Invasive Species Simulation**  
Simulated Arctic ecosystems to study extinction risk from invasive king crabs. Ran 5,000+ simulations with >99% ML model accuracy in predicting outcomes.

☕ **On My Grind**  
A fun React + JS app (like Wordle!) for quizzing Starbucks drink recipes. Real data. Real fun. Real coffee.
